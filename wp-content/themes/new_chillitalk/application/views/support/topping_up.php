<h3>Topping-Up</h3>
<div class="cssaver1 leftcom">
  <p>

<h3>
How do I top-up my Chillitalk account?</h3>
<p>
The easiest way is to use the top-up page. There you can use your credit or debit card to make instant payments. Alternatively you can top-up by purchasing an e-voucher and entering its top-up code here.
</p>
<h3>
 How do I check my balance?</h3>
<p>
You can check you balance in your account. If you use the Chillitalk App then you can view your balance on that. You need at least <?php echo $this->session->userdata('currency_symbol_web'); ?>1 of credit to make a call. 
</p>
<h3>
My top-up credit hasn’t appeared in my account. What should I do?</h3>
<p>
You should receive your top-up credit immediately. If you experience a slight delay with your payment being authorised, we will continue trying to complete your transaction until successful. 
</p>
<h3>What is auto top-up?</h3>
<p>
Auto Top-Up is a way of topping- up your mobile automatically, so you don’t have to remember to do it. We’ll automatically top-up your mobile when your balance gets low. You can select how much you want to be automatically added in your account.
</p>
<h3> My auto top-up hasn’t happened. What should I do?</h3>
<p>
If something goes wrong with your auto top-up, we’ll text and email you to let you know it hasn’t worked. 
</p>
<h3> How do I activate/deactivate auto top-up? </h3>
<p>
Please go to the <a href="http://chillitalk.co.uk/en/myaccount/top_up/">Top-up</a> page and select auto top-up OFF.
