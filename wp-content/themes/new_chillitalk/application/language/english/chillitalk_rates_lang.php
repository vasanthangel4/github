landline?</h3> 
<p>In most countries calls to mobile phones costs a little more. Rates are always clearly published on our website, 
so <a href='http://chillitalk.co.uk/en/rates/'>check</a> to be sure.
</p>
<h3>Are there any additional charges or hidden fees? </h3> 
<p>
We only charge what we tell you. When you make a payment we give you the full amount as calling credit, and we will 
only charge you the 'per minute' rate for calls as <a href='http://chillitalk.co.uk/en/rates/'>shown</a> on our site. 
There are no connection charges, maintenance or service charges, or other hidden costs.</p>
  
<h3>Is there a rate difference if I call from my landline or mobile phone? </h3> 
<p>No, there is no difference. You will get the same low rates whether you use your landline or mobile phone. 
The only difference might be when calling the Access Number via mobile and not using your free minutes. You may be 
charged for a local call by your network provider.</p>
    
<h3>Why can I make free calls to other Chillitalk users, but am charged for other calls?  </h3> 
   
<p> Calls to other Chillitalk users are free because they are not made like regular phone calls, they're made 
using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). The calls do not require that you have the other user's phone number as 
long as you and the other Chillitalk App user both have a piece of information from your Chillitalk account, 
then we can make a connection between the two of you.</p>
   
<h3>Will I be charged by my landline / mobile provider for calling your Access Numbers?  </h3> 
   
<p>Your Access Numbers are just normal, local landline numbers so they should be included in any free minutes 
included in your PAYG or contract. If you don't have any free inclusive minutes you should be charged at your 
provider's usual landline rate. </p>
<h3>Will my phone carrier charge me when I call from my mobile phone using Chillitalk?</h3> 
   
<p>Chillitalk Local Number calls are charged by your phone carrier as a local call. As such, if you have unlimited 
calling minutes, you should not be charged by your phone carrier.
<br/><br/>
If you use the Chillitalk App, you can choose to make a call using the internet instead of a Local Number. 
This means that you will be charged for the data but not for a local call. If you have an unlimited data plan, 
your phone carrier will not charge you. If you call using the internet and do not have an unlimited data plan, 
your phone carrier will charge you as they normally do for data usage.
