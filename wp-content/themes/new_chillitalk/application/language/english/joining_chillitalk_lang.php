<p><br/> 
Simply dial one of your Local Numbers from the phone number you provided when you signed up. (You can also make calls 
from other phones - just be sure to register those numbers with us first, otherwise learn about Access Numbers";

You&#39;ll be connected at Chillitalk&#39;s low rates (and your phone carrier will treat this just like a local call).
<br/><br/> 
Any phone: You can call from any phone (to any phone) with Chillitalk. You will just need access to our website to 
sign-up and manage your account.
<br/><br/> 
iPhone / Android devices: If you have one of these devices, you have the option to download our Chillitalk App. 
You&#39;ll be able to make calls with your contract/PAYG minutes or via Wi-Fi/3G (so it works on devices that 
don&#39;t have a phone plan too, like your tablet or PC). Plus, you can call other Chillitalk app users for free!
<br/><br/>  
<h3>Can I have more than one account with Chillitalk?</h3><br/><br/> 
Unfortunately no, we only allow one account per customer. However, there is no limit to how many devices you can 
register with your account. So you can call from your mobile, landline, office and even register the phone numbers of 
your family members - all under the one account. Please note, we advise that you do not register phones that you do 
not control usage of, such as public phones or a shared office phone. To make calls from these phones simply dial one 
of the Local Numbers you created through Chillitalk and you&#39;ll be prompted to enter your PIN, once 
identified you&#39;ll be connected.
