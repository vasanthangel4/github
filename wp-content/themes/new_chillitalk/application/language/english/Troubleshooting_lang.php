E.G., a public phone or a friend's phone? </h3><p>Yes. However, so that we can be sure it is you, we will ask you to 
provide an 11-digit PIN code. You can find this number by logging into 
<a href='http://chillitalk.co.uk/en/myaccount/registered_number/'>My Account</a>.</p><h3>How do I place an 
international call using Chillitalk?</h3><p>Make sure you are calling from a registered phone. Then call the 
Chillitalk Local Number assigned to the contact you wish to call. Make sure you have enough credit in your account 
for your call to be connected.</p><h3>Why am I asked for a PIN code when I make a Local Numbers call?</h3><p>There are 
two reasons why this might happen:1. You have called from a number that's not registered with us.<br/>  <br/>
2. Your Caller ID is hidden. This means we can't identify your phone and will ask for your account number and PIN code. 
Your Caller ID is the number that displays when you call someone. If you enable your caller ID we should be able to 
identify your phone and we won't need to ask for your PIN code.</p>
<h3>Calls are connecting to the wrong numbers - why? </h3><p>If you're calling from a phone number which is on a 
different account, you could be connected to the wrong person because the local numbers you call aren't unique to you 
or your account. Therefore other users will be calling the same Local Numbers. The part that's linked to your account
 is where these numbers connect to. That means if you call from someone else's registered phone you could be 
 connected to their contact.</p>");
