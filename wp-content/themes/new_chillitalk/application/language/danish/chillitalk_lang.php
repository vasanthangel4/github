Are the rates different if I call a mobile or a landline? 	
 </h3> 
 
 <p>If you call a mobile phone in most countries, the rates will be a little higher. Rates are always clearly published on our website, so check there to be sure.
</p>
  <h3>Are there any additional charges or hidden fees? </h3> 
   <p>
We only charge what we tell you. When you make a payment we give you the full amount as calling credit, and we will only charge you the ‘per minute’ rate for calls as shown on our site. There are no connection charges, maintenance or service charges, or other hidden costs.   </p>
  
 <h3> Is there a rate difference if I call from my home or mobile phone? </h3> 
      <p> No, there is no difference. You will get the same low rates whether you use your landline or mobile phone. The only difference might be when calling the Access Number via mobile and not using your free minutes.  </p>
    
   <h3>Why can I make free calls to other Chillitalk users, but am charged for other calls? </h3> 
   
      <p> Calls to other Chillitalk users are free because they are not made like regular phone calls, they’re made using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). The calls do not require that you have the other user's phone number as long as you and the other Chillitalk app user both have a piece of information from your Chillitalk account, then we can make a connection between the two of you. </p>
   
    <h3>Will I be charged by my landline / mobile provider for calling your Access Numbers? </h3> 
   
         <p> Your Access Numbers are just normal, local landline numbers so they should be included in any free minutes included in your PAYG or contract. If you don’t have any free inclusive minutes you should be charged at your provider’s usual landline rate.  </p>
       <h3>Will my phone carrier charge me when I call from my mobile phone using Chillitalk?  </h3> 
   
         <p> Chillitalk Local Number calls are charged by your phone carrier as a local call. As such, if you have an unlimited calling minutes, you should not be charged by your phone carrier.
         
         <br/>   <br/>
         If you use the Chillitalk app, you can choose to make a call using the internet instead of a Local Number. This means that you will be charged for the data but not for a local call. If you have an unlimited data plan, your phone carrier will not charge you. If you call using the Internet and do not have an unlimited data plan, your phone carrier will charge you as they normally do for data usage.

Please note, we advise that you do not register phones that you do not control usage of, such as public phones or a shared office phone. To make calls from these phones simply dial one of the Local Numbers you created through Chillitalk and you'll be prompted to enter your PIN, once identified you'll be connected.

  </p>
   <h3>Can I use the app overseas?  </h3>

Calls are connecting to the wrong numbers – why? </h3> 
 
 <p>If you're calling from a phone number which is on a different account, you could be connected to the wrong person because the local numbers you call aren't unique to you or your account. Therefore other users will be calling the same local numbers. The part that's linked to your account is where these numbers connect to. That means if you call from someone else's registered phone you could be connected to their contact.
</p>
  <h3>
Can I use Chillitalk from a phone that is not registered, such as a public phone or a friend’s phone?
 </h3> 
   <p>
Yes. However, so that we can be sure it is you, we will ask you to provide an 11-digit PIN. You can find this number by logging into your ‘My Account’ section  </p>
  
 <h3>How do I place an international call using Chillitalk? </h3> 
      <p> Make sure you are calling from a registered phone. Then call the Chillitalk Local Number assigned to the contact you wish to call. Make sure you have enough credit in your account for your call to be connected.  </p>
    
   <h3>What is a Chillitalk Access Number?  </h3> 
   
      <p> If you would like to call a number at Chillitalk rates which you do not have a Local Number created for, you can use an Access Number. Find an Access Number local to you in ‘My Account’. If you dial this number from a registered phone you will simply be asked to enter the international number you would like to call, and you will be connected at Chillitalk rates. If you dial an Access Number from a phone that is not registered to your account, you will also need to enter your 11-digit PIN. </p>
   
    <h3>Why am I asked for a PIN when I make a Local Numbers call? </h3> 
   
         <p> There are two reasons why this might happen
         
         <br/>     
         <br/>
         1. You have called from a number that’s not registered with us. 
            <br/>     
         <br/>
         2. Your Caller ID is hidden. This means we can’t identify your phone and will ask for your account number and PIN. Your Caller ID is the number that displays when you call someone. If you enable your caller ID we should be able to identify your phone and we won’t need to ask for your PIN.
         
         
         </p>
       <h3>Will my phone carrier charge me when I call from my mobile phone using Chillitalk?  </h3> 
   
         <p> Chillitalk Local Number calls are charged by your phone carrier as a local call. As such, if you have an unlimited calling minutes, you should not be charged by your phone carrier.
         
         <br/>   <br/>
         If you use the Chillitalk app, you can choose to make a call using the internet instead of a Local Number. This means that you will be charged for the data but not for a local call. If you have an unlimited data plan, your phone carrier will not charge you. If you call using the Internet and do not have an unlimited data plan, your phone carrier will charge you as they normally do for data usage.
